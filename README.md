# Fast Dawid-Skene
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/GoodDeeds/Fast-Dawid-Skene.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/GoodDeeds/Fast-Dawid-Skene)

Implementation of the Fast Dawid-Skene and Hybrid algorithms described in the paper

Vaibhav B Sinha, Sukrut Rao, Vineeth N Balasubramanian. Fast Dawid-Skene: A Fast Vote Aggregation Scheme for Sentiment Classification. KDD WISDOM 2018.

Implementations of the Dawid-Skene (Dawid and Skene, 1979) and Majority Voting algorithms are also provided.

These algorithms can be used to aggregate crowd-sourced labels to estimate the true labels. Given the labels of a data point from many annotators out of a set of classes, the algorithms output the most likely correct class for the data point.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
The prerequisites are:
* Python 2.7 or 3.4-3.6
* pip

### Setting up dependencies
All other dependencies can be installed using pip, as
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If tests are to be run, use instead,
```
$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Preparing the data
A description of the data format and the procedure to add a new dataset is given [here](data/README.md). A toy dataset is also provided, and can be found [here](data/toy_dataset).

## Running the program
To run the program, use
```
$ python scripts/fast_dawid_skene.py [OPTIONS]
```

To view a list of available options along with descriptions, use
```
$ python scripts/fast_dawid_skene.py --help
```

### Example Run
To run on the toy dataset, with two annotators per question, using the FDS algorithm to obtain predictions, use
```
$ python scripts/fast_dawid_skene.py --dataset toy --k 2 --mode aggregate --algorithm FDS --print_result
```
To run using all available annotations for every question, using the FDS algorithm to obtain predictions, use 
```
$ python scripts/fast_dawid_skene.py --dataset toy --mode aggregate --algorithm FDS --print_result
```

### Running tests
Tests can be run using pytest, as,
```
$ py.test
```
